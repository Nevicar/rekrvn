(:require rekrvn.core)

publish events via (rekrvn.core/broadcast [content replyfn])

replyFn is a function to be used by other modules in order to respond to published events.
For example, the irc module provides a replyFn that sends message to the channel from which
the message originated.

subscribe to events/messages via (rekrvn.core/addListener [matcher actFn])
matcher is an re-pattern to match applicable publications
actFn is the function to be called on matching publications. As arguments, it takes
a list containing the parenthesized groups in matcher and a replyFn.

See modules/example.clj for examples.

to do so via (rekrvn.core/addCleanup module cleanupFn)
